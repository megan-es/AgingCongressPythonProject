# CongressPythonVizProject
Data sourced from https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/congress-demographics
In this project I created a dictionary to map party codes to party names for enhanced readability and standardized capitalization of names for future use in making a Tableau visualization.
I also utilized matplotlib to create a visualization showing how average age of congress members has changed over time.
